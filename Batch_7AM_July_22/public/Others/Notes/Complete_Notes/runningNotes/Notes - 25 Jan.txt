<img> </img>  Image Tag  :   Images can be added to Web page

 

<img>  is a pre-defined tag, supported in HTML using which we could add an image to the web page. It takes mandatory attribute 'src' through which we can specify the absolute or relative path of an external image resource

 

One <img> tag is used to add one single image and multiple images can be added to a page using multiple <img> tags

 

 

 

Syntax:  <img src=" .. Absolute/relative path"/>

 

Example:   <img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8AZPuwgoO2E/UL0uVS877RI/AAAAAAAB4tU/5dLKQgiPWck/s1600/India_Flag11.jpg"/>

 

 

Absolute Path:              Specify the full URL Path/location of the image/resource

 

Relative  Path:               Specifying resource that is relative to HTML Page, which means when images are saved on local, we can specify the saved image name with extension and it should work on page.
