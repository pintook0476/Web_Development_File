            That’s correct; it takes Neptune a whopping <b>165</b> years to complete its orbit of the sun, whilst Earth takes only 365 days and 5 hours. Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet in our Solar System, The Milky Way. Urbain Le Verrier officially discovered and charted the location of Neptune in 1846. Although Galileo Galilei actually discovered Neptune way back in 1612, but dismissed it as a star using his primitive telescope. Fast-forward to the 11th of July 2011 and Neptune finally.
